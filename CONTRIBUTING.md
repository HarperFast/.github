# Contributing to Harper

Harper supplies both **open source** and **source available** projects.

By default, we generally always accept contributions to **open source** projects, but currently do not accept contributions to **source available** projects.

This may change over time or on a case-by-case basis, so please check the specific repository's `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and `LICENSE` files for details.

Contributors are encouraged to communicate with maintainers in issues or other channels (such as our community [Discord](https://harper.fast/discord)) before submitting changes.

## Code of Conduct

Harper has a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that all contributors are expected to follow.
